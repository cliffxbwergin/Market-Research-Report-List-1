<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural fans market is primarily divided into two types: centrifugal fans and axial fans. Centrifugal fans use a rotating impeller to increase air pressure and are ideal for applications requiring high resistance, such as ventilation in barns or grain storage. Axial fans, on the other hand, move air parallel to the fanâ€™s axis, providing high airflow rates and are commonly used for cooling in crop drying processes or livestock barns. Both types enhance efficiency and airflow in agricultural operations.</p></p>
