<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-intermittent Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated Self-intermittent Catheter</li><li>Non Coated Self-intermittent Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-intermittent catheter market is divided into two primary types: coated and non-coated catheters. Coated self-intermittent catheters are designed with a special lubrication layer, enhancing comfort during insertion and reducing the risk of urinary tract infections. Non-coated self-intermittent catheters, on the other hand, are simpler in design without any added lubrication or treatment. Both types serve the same fundamental purpose of facilitating intermittent bladder drainage, but they differ in user experience and infection risk management.</p></p>
